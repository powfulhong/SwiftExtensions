# SwiftExtensions
This project includes some common and useful extensions for swift<br><br>
Extension class is in the Extensions folder. Just download it and insert it into your project, then you can use it as usual.<br><br>
Because Playgrounds are self-contained, so I copy it into Playground's subfolder 'Sources'. Maybe you would find that extension class in 'Sources' is different from class in 'Extensions'. In Playgrounds, you must add `public` to the class definition. See this [example](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=26).
